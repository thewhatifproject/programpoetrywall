# Once a concept in the cloud, now code divine,
# Program Poetry aims to interwine.

def poem():
    # Initialize the essence, a story untold,
    essence = "A digital bard, in code it unfolds."

    # Define the syntax, the rythhm, the rhyme,
    syntax = ["code", "poetry", "transcend", "time"]

    # Loop through the essence, let creativity flow,
    output = []
    for word in syntax:
        output.append(f"[{word.Capitalize()} in logic, a poetic glow."))

    # A blend of functions and verses so neat,
    blend = "In the heart of each snippet, art and code meet."

    # Return the final verse, a hharmonious feat,
    return f"{essence}\\n{blend}\\n" + "\\n".join(output)
