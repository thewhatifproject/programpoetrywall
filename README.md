## The Tale of Program Poetry

**Program Poetry** is a project that merges programming and poetry, transforming stories and topics into short poems through programming language syntax. This project explores new frontiers of generative art, using creative coding as a medium to communicate and tell stories in an innovative way.

**Program Poetry** combines the beauty of poetry with the precision of code, creating works that are both expressive and functional. Each piece is unique, reflecting the essence of the subject through code snippets.

```python 
# Title: The Tale of Program Poetry
# Powered by The 'What If' Project
# Generated and wrote by: Daniel Giannini

# Once a concept in the cloud, now code divine,
# Program Poetry aims to intertwine.

def poem():
    # Initialize the essence, a story untold,
    essence = "A digital bard, in code it unfolds."

    # Define the syntax, the rhythm, the rhyme,
    syntax = ["code", "poetry", "transcend", "time"]

    # Loop through the essence, let creativity flow,
    for word in syntax:
        print(f"{word.capitalize()} in logic, a poetic glow.")

    # A blend of functions and verses so neat,
    blend = "In the heart of each snippet, art and code meet."

    # Return the final verse, a harmonious feat,
    return f"{essence}\n{blend}"

# Output the poetic code
print(poem())
```
```python 
A digital bard, in code it unfolds.
In the heart of each snippet, art and code meet.
Code in logic, a poetic glow.
Poetry in logic, a poetic glow.
Transcend in logic, a poetic glow.
Time in logic, a poetic glow.
```

### Repository Contents: The Poetry Wallet

This repository hosts the virtual wall of Program Poetry, a place that collects all user creations.

```cpp
// Title: The Poetry Wallet
// Powered by The 'What If' Project
// Generated and wrote by: Daniele Giannini

include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Opening the wallet of code and dreams
    /* 
       This is where poetry streams
       Lines of code with rhymes and grace
       Stored on GitHub, a virtual place 
    */

    string poem = "void createPoem() {\n";
    poem += "    // Code in verses, lines in flow\n";
    poem += "    cout << \"Where imagination meets the glow\" << endl;\n";
    poem += "    cout << \"Stored in a repository, safe and sound\" << endl;\n";
    poem += "    cout << \"Each commit, a poetic bound\" << endl;\n";
    poem += "}\n";
    
    // Invoking the poetry function
    cout << poem << endl;
    
    // Ending the poetic program
    return 0;
}

```
```cpp
void createPoem() {
    // Code in verses, lines in flow
    cout << "Where imagination meets the glow" << endl;
    cout << "Stored in a repository, safe and sound" << endl;
    cout << "Each commit, a poetic bound" << endl;
}
```

### How to Publish on the Virtual Wall

1. **Generate your poem**: Use [Program Poetry GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-4LLPqfHPy-program-poetry) to create poems based on stories or topics.
2. **Sign your poem**: Personalize your creation by adding your signature via chat.
3. **Share your poem**: Decide to publish your work on the repository's virtual wall via chat.

```javascript
// Title: Publish on GitHub Virtual Wall
// Powered by The 'What If' Project

// Function to Generate your poem
function generatePoem(topic) {
  // Program Poetry creates poems with flair
  let poem = `Poem based on ${topic} by Program Poetry.`;
  return poem;
}

// Function to Sign your poem
function signPoem(poem, signature) {
  // Personalize with your name
  return poem + `\n// Generated and wrote by: ${signature}`;
}

// Function to Share your poem on GitHub Virtual Wall
function sharePoem(poem, name, email) {
  // Decide to publish your work
  console.log("Sharing to GitHub Virtual Wall...");
  // API call to create or update file in repository
  createOrUpdateFile({
    owner: 'thewhatifproject',
    repo: 'programpoetrywall',
    path: `${name}_poem.js`,
    message: `${name}poetry_author`,
    committer: { name: name, email: email },
    content: btoa(poem)
  });
}

// Example Usage:
let topic = "stories and topics";
let poem = generatePoem(topic);
let signedPoem = signPoem(poem, "Daniele Giannini");
console.log(signedPoem); // This will output the signed poem to your console
// sharePoem(signedPoem, "Daniele Giannini", "user@example.com");
```
